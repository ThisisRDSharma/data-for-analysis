To classify a borrower’s file as a **thin credit file** or a **thick credit file** using the variables you have, you can follow a systematic approach. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to use these variables to make this classification, along with examples and methods for implementation.

### Step-by-Step Classification Process

#### 1. **Understand the Variables**

Here’s a brief recap of what each variable represents and how it might relate to file thickness:

| Variable                | Description                                               | Relation to Credit File Thickness                         |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **GrossOrigRecvPN**    | Total amount of new receivables or credit origination.  | Reflects volume but not the history of credit data.      |
| **HighCreditPN**       | Highest amount of credit extended to the business.       | Shows maximum credit exposure but not credit history depth. |
| **OutstandingRecvPN**  | Total amount of receivables currently unpaid.           | Shows current credit risk but not the file thickness.     |
| **LastDelinqPN**       | Most recent date of delinquency.                         | Indicates recent credit issues but not the file depth.    |
| **Total31PN**          | Total amount of 31-day delinquencies.                    | Reflects past delinquencies but not directly file thickness. |
| **TotalScorePN**       | Overall credit score.                                   | Summarizes creditworthiness but not thickness.           |
| **PaymentPastDuePN**   | Total amount of overdue payments.                        | Reflects current delinquencies but not the credit file’s depth. |
| **OldestContractDatePN** | Date of the oldest credit account.                        | Directly indicates the length of the credit history.      |
| **DueToDatePN**        | Date for the most recent payment or due date.             | Tracks upcoming payments but not directly related to file thickness. |

#### 2. **Define Criteria for Thin vs. Thick Files**

**Thin Credit File:** Typically characterized by:
- **Short Credit History:** Recent OldestContractDatePN.
- **Limited Credit Accounts:** Few accounts or recent credit origination.
- **Limited Credit Activity:** Low GrossOrigRecvPN and HighCreditPN.

**Thick Credit File:** Typically characterized by:
- **Long Credit History:** Older OldestContractDatePN.
- **Diverse Credit Accounts:** Multiple credit accounts over a long period.
- **Substantial Credit Activity:** Higher GrossOrigRecvPN and HighCreditPN.

#### 3. **Develop Classification Criteria**

Here are some practical criteria based on your variables to classify a credit file:

- **Length of Credit History:**
  - **Thin:** `OldestContractDatePN` is within the past 2 years.
  - **Thick:** `OldestContractDatePN` is older than 2 years.

- **Number of Accounts or Amount of Credit Activity:**
  - **Thin:** `GrossOrigRecvPN` is low (e.g., < $100,000) and `HighCreditPN` is low (e.g., < $50,000).
  - **Thick:** `GrossOrigRecvPN` is high (e.g., > $100,000) and `HighCreditPN` is high (e.g., > $50,000).

- **Credit Delinquencies:**
  - **Thin:** **High** `PaymentPastDuePN`, **recent** `LastDelinqPN`.
  - **Thick:** **Low** `PaymentPastDuePN`, **past** `LastDelinqPN`.

#### 4. **Implement Classification Rules**

Below is a sample Python code snippet for classifying a credit file based on the criteria mentioned above. This is a simple example, and you may need to adjust the thresholds and logic based on your specific dataset and business requirements.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Example dataset
data = {
    'GrossOrigRecvPN': [50000, 200000, 120000, 80000],
    'HighCreditPN': [40000, 150000, 60000, 20000],
    'OutstandingRecvPN': [10000, 15000, 20000, 5000],
    'LastDelinqPN': ['2023-06-01', '2021-04-15', '2022-07-20', '2019-11-30'],
    'Total31PN': [1000, 3000, 2500, 200],
    'TotalScorePN': [720, 680, 710, 750],
    'PaymentPastDuePN': [500, 1000, 700, 100],
    'OldestContractDatePN': ['2018-05-01', '2020-01-15', '2015-11-30', '2012-07-10'],
    'DueToDatePN': ['2024-08-15', '2024-01-10', '2024-05-30', '2024-02-20']
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Convert dates
df['OldestContractDatePN'] = pd.to_datetime(df['OldestContractDatePN'])
df['LastDelinqPN'] = pd.to_datetime(df['LastDelinqPN'])

# Define classification function
def classify_credit_file(row):
    today = pd.Timestamp.now()
    
    # Define criteria for thin vs. thick file
    is_thin = (
        (today - row['OldestContractDatePN']).days < 730  # OldestContractDatePN is within the past 2 years
        and row['GrossOrigRecvPN'] < 100000  # Low GrossOrigRecvPN
        and row['HighCreditPN'] < 50000  # Low HighCreditPN
    )
    
    is_thick = (
        (today - row['OldestContractDatePN']).days >= 730  # OldestContractDatePN is older than 2 years
        and row['GrossOrigRecvPN'] >= 100000  # High GrossOrigRecvPN
        and row['HighCreditPN'] >= 50000  # High HighCreditPN
    )
    
    # Additional conditions based on delinquencies
    if row['PaymentPastDuePN'] > 1000 or row['Total31PN'] > 1000:
        is_thin = True  # High overdue payments or 31-day delinquencies could indicate a thin file
    
    if row['LastDelinqPN'] > today - pd.DateOffset(years=2):
        is_thin = True  # Recent delinquency may indicate a thinner file
    
    # Final classification
    if is_thick:
        return 'Thick Credit File'
    elif is_thin:
        return 'Thin Credit File'
    else:
        return 'Moderate Credit File'  # For cases that do not clearly fall into thin or thick

# Apply the classification
df['CreditFileType'] = df.apply(classify_credit_file, axis=1)

print(df[['GrossOrigRecvPN', 'HighCreditPN', 'OutstandingRecvPN', 'LastDelinqPN', 'Total31PN', 'TotalScorePN', 'PaymentPastDuePN', 'OldestContractDatePN', 'DueToDatePN', 'CreditFileType']])
```

### Explanation of the Classification Code

- **Convert Dates:** Dates are converted to `datetime` objects for comparison.
- **Define Criteria:** Rules for what constitutes a thin vs. thick file based on `OldestContractDatePN`, `GrossOrigRecvPN`, and `HighCreditPN`, along with other indicators of credit behavior.
- **Apply Function:** The function `classify_credit_file` applies the rules to classify each file.

### Considerations and Adjustments

- **Thresholds:** Adjust the thresholds (e.g., $100,000 for `GrossOrigRecvPN`, 2 years for `OldestContractDatePN`) based on your data and industry standards.
- **Additional Variables:** You might consider including other variables or data points depending on your specific use case.
- **Complex Rules:** For more complex models, consider building a scoring model or using machine learning techniques for classification.
